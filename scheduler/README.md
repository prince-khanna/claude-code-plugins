# Scheduler Plugin

Schedule automated Claude Code tasks across macOS, Linux, and Windows. Manage recurring execution of marketplace skills, freeform prompts, and shell scripts with safety controls and desktop notifications.

## Prerequisites

- Prince Plugins marketplace added — see [main README](../README.md)
- `uv` for running the Python engine

## Installation

```
/plugin install scheduler@prince-plugins
```

When prompted, select **"Install for you (user scope)"** — the first and recommended option.

Restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Scheduler Backend   | Artifacts                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS    | launchd             | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.launchpad.scheduler.{id}.plist`       |
| Linux    | systemd user timers | `~/.config/systemd/user/launchpad-scheduler-{id}.{service,timer}` |
| Windows  | Task Scheduler      | `schtasks.exe` with XML import (`\launchpad\Scheduler\{id}`)      |

The platform is auto-detected at runtime. Each task records which platform it was created on.

## Skills

### manage

Conversational orchestrator for scheduling tasks. Invoke via `/manage` (or `/scheduler:manage`).

**Operations:**
- Add a new scheduled task (skill, prompt, or script)
- List all scheduled tasks
- Pause/resume a task
- Remove a task
- View results from a task
- View logs for a task
- Run a task now (test)
- Cleanup old logs and results

**Example:** "Schedule a task every day at 9am that summarizes my emails based on priority."

## How It Works

1. Tasks are defined in a JSON registry at `<project>/.claude/scheduler/registry.json`
2. Each task gets a wrapper script at `<scheduler_dir>/wrappers/{id}.sh` (or `.ps1` on Windows)
3. Each task gets a platform-native schedule artifact (plist, systemd units, or Task Scheduler entry)
4. The platform scheduler fires the wrapper at the scheduled time
5. The wrapper runs `claude -p` (for skills/prompts) or `bash`/PowerShell (for scripts)
6. Results saved to `<scheduler_dir>/results/{id}/YYYY-MM-DD/{id}-HHMMSS.md`
7. Logs saved to `<scheduler_dir>/logs/{id}/YYYY-MM-DD.log`
8. Claude Code JSONL session log path captured in the registry (for skill/prompt tasks)
9. Desktop notification on completion or failure

## Architecture

```
scheduler/skills/manage/scripts/
  scheduler.py              # Core engine (delegates to platform backend)
  platform_detect.py        # Auto-detects OS and returns appropriate backend
  backends/
    base.py                 # PlatformBackend ABC
    macos.py                # launchd plist + launchctl
    linux.py                # systemd .service + .timer units
    windows.py              # Task Scheduler XML + schtasks.exe
```

## Updating

After updating the plugin, regenerate wrappers for existing tasks to pick up template changes:

```
/manage → select "Repair" → confirm force regeneration
```

This regenerates all wrapper scripts from the latest templates without affecting schedules or results.

## Requirements

- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Claude Code CLI (`claude` in PATH)
