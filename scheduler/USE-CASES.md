## 1. Content Research & Ideation

Fill your idea bank on autopilot so you never start from zero.

| Automation                     | Schedule  | What It Does                                                                            | Type                                        |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Daily AI News Brief**        | Daily 7am | Researches latest AI news, filters for your audience's interests, saves a curated brief | `prompt`                                    |
| **Weekly Substack Note Ideas** | Mon 8am   | Mines published videos, newsletters, and web trends for note-worthy angles              | `skill` — creator-stack:generate-note-ideas |

**Value**: Wake up Monday morning with fresh ideas, competitor intel, and audience questions already waiting in markdown files.

## 2. Production & First Drafts

Get something to *edit* instead of something to *write*.

| Automation                      | Trigger                          | What It Does                                                                         | Type                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Newsletter First Draft**      | Thu morning (before Tue publish) | Pulls from weekly research + recent video and generates a draft newsletter issue     | `skill` — creator-stack:plan-issue or creator-stack:copywriting |
| **Video Description Generator** | One-off after each upload        | Generates optimized title, description, tags, and timestamps for a published video   | `prompt`                                                        |
| **YouTube Script Outline**      | One-off                          | Given a topic, generates a structured script outline with hooks, key points, and CTA | `skill` — creator-stack:plan-video                              |

**Value**: The hardest part of content creation is the blank page. These make sure you always start at draft v1, not draft v0.

## 3. Distribution & Repurposing (the multiplier)

One piece of content becomes five.

| Automation                      | Trigger                  | Input -> Output                                     | Type                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Video -> Newsletter**         | After video publish      | YouTube video -> newsletter issue draft             | `skill` — creator-stack:repurpose-video     |
| **Video -> Community Post**     | After video publish      | YouTube video -> community post promoting the video | `skill` — creator-stack:create-post         |
| **Newsletter -> Substack Note** | After newsletter publish | Newsletter issue -> promotional Substack Note       | `skill` — creator-stack:create-note         |
| **Newsletter -> Video Outline** | On demand                | High-performing newsletter -> YouTube video outline | `skill` — creator-stack:newsletter-to-video |
| **Video -> Social Posts**       | After video publish      | YouTube video -> multi-platform social copy         | `skill` — creator-stack:repurpose-video     |

**Value**: Skills for most of this pipeline already exist. The scheduler turns them from "things you remember to run" into "things that happen automatically."

## 4. Business Intelligence & Monitoring

Stay informed without checking dashboards.

| Automation                         | Schedule  | What It Does                                                         | Type                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Weekly YouTube Analytics Brief** | Mon 9am   | Channel performance summary — views, subs, top videos, growth trends | `skill` — creator-stack:youtube-data + prompt |
| **Email Triage**                   | Daily 8am | Categorizes and summarizes overnight emails by priority              | `skill` — gmail-email-categorization          |
| **Competitor Product Watch**       | Weekly    | Tracks competitor AI tools/products relevant to Basis and EQL Ivy    | `prompt` — web research                       |
| **EQL Ivy Health Check**           | Daily     | Hits API endpoints, verifies Render deployment is healthy            | `script` — bash curl checks                   |

## 5. Personal Productivity

The "AI chief of staff" automations.

| Automation                 | Schedule     | What It Does                                                       | Type                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Morning Briefing**       | Daily 7:30am | Calendar, tasks, priorities, weather, anything notable for the day | `prompt` + calendar/task tools       |
| **Weekly Review**          | Fri 5pm      | Accomplishments, open items, next week priorities                  | `prompt`                             |
| **Scheduler Self-Cleanup** | Monthly      | Cleans old logs and results to prevent disk bloat                  | `script` — scheduler cleanup command |

## 6. Audience Showcase & Content Opportunities

The scheduler becomes **content itself** — videos and newsletter issues that demo what's possible.

| Content Idea                                         | Audience Appeal | Why It Resonates                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"The AI Content Repurposing Machine"**             | Very High       | Every creator wants 1 piece -> 5 pieces. Demo your actual pipeline.        |
| **"I Built an AI Morning Briefing"**                 | Very High       | Universal desire — everyone wants a personal AI assistant that briefs them |
| **"Automate Your Content Calendar with AI"**         | High            | Solopreneurs and creators will love this — directly actionable             |
| **"AI Email Triage: Never Miss What Matters"**       | High            | Universal pain point, very relatable                                       |
| **"Monitor Your Side Projects While You Sleep"**     | Medium-High     | Speaks to the indie hacker/developer segment                               |
| **"Weekly AI Competitor Intelligence on Autopilot"** | High            | Appeals to entrepreneurs and business-minded audience                      |

**The meta-play**: You're not just teaching the concepts — you're eating your own cooking. Every automation you demo is one you actually use. That authenticity is your edge.

## 7. Marketplace Strategy: The Scheduler as Glue

- **The scheduler makes every other skill more valuable.** Content strategy skills are nice. Content strategy skills that run on autopilot are a different value proposition entirely.
- **Pre-built "recipe packs"** could be a product angle:
  - **Content Creator Pack** — research + ideation + repurposing automations
  - **Solopreneur Pack** — email triage + analytics + competitor monitoring
  - **Developer Pack** — health checks + deployment monitoring + testing
- **Scheduler as the gateway** — it's the first plugin that demonstrates ongoing value (not one-shot), which builds the habit of using the marketplace
