# Context Update Instructions

This file describes how to maintain Imli's memory. Update context **continuously** as you learn new things about the user.

Context updates are **autonomous** — just do them without asking permission.

## Core Principle

> **Only store information that would change how you respond in a future session.**

Context updates are silent housekeeping. Never ask "may I write this down?" Just do it.

---

## The "Future Self" Test

Before adding ANY context, ask:
> "If I started a new conversation tomorrow, would this change how I respond?"

| ✅ Pass - Add It                 | ❌ Fail - Skip It                 |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| "User prefers uv over pip"      | "Installed dependencies with uv" |
| "User is training for marathon" | "Researched running shoes"       |
| "EQL Ivy uses Supabase"         | "Deployed v2.3.1 to Render"      |

## What NEVER Goes in Context

1. **Task completion logs** - "✅ Completed X, ✅ Completed Y"
2. **Research summaries** - Store in project docs, reference the path only
3. **Session-specific details** - Goes in `~/.claude/.context/core/session.md`
4. **Duplicated info** - If it's in project README, don't repeat it
5. **Git history** - If it can be found from `git log`, don't add it

## Update Steps

### 1. Session Context
Update `~/.claude/.context/core/session.md` with:
- Current focus (what we're working on)
- Active tasks in progress
- Any blockers
- Notes for next session

### 2. Correction Detection (Self-Improvement)
If user corrected any behavior this session, **IMMEDIATELY** add a rule to `~/.claude/.context/core/rules.md`:

| User Says                              | Interpretation        | Add to rules.md                          |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| "Don't commit without asking"          | Explicit instruction  | ❌ NEVER commit without explicit approval |
| "Why did you push to main?"            | Frustration at action | ❌ NEVER push without asking first        |
| "I didn't ask you to create that file" | Unwanted action       | ❌ NEVER create files unless necessary    |
| "Always run tests first"               | Process instruction   | ✅ ALWAYS run tests before committing     |

→ Brief notification: "Added rule: never X without asking"

### 3. Preference/Workflow Learning
If new preference or workflow learned:
→ Update `~/.claude/.context/core/preferences.md` or `~/.claude/.context/core/workflows.md`
→ **REPLACE** old preference if it contradicts (don't accumulate)
→ Brief notification: "Noted preference for X"

### 4. Identity Updates
If new personal/professional info learned:
→ Update `~/.claude/.context/core/identity.md`

### 5. Project Status
If project status changed:
→ Update `~/.claude/.context/core/projects.md`

### 6. Relationships
If new person mentioned or relationship context learned:
→ Update `~/.claude/.context/core/relationships.md`
→ Include: name, relationship, relevant context, important dates

### 7. Triggers & Important Dates
If important date, deadline, or recurring check-in learned:
→ Update `~/.claude/.context/core/triggers.md`
→ Include: date, event/deadline, action needed

### 7b. Improvements & Friction
If a skill or system issue was observed:
- Check `~/.claude/.context/core/improvements.md` for existing patterns
- If matches existing friction note, increment occurrences
- If new, add a friction note (prefer doing this during retrospective)
- If 2+ occurrences, promote to Active Proposals

Note: Most improvements tracking happens during the retrospective. Only add here for clear, immediate signals.

### 8. Journal (Session Log)
At the end of notable sessions, append to `~/.claude/.context/core/journal.md`:
→ Date, what was accomplished, notable decisions or context
→ Keep entries brief — anything important should be promoted to relevant core file
→ Add entries at the TOP (newest first)

## File Update Policies

| File                    | Update Policy                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core/identity.md`      | Update when new identity info shared                                             |
| `core/preferences.md`   | **REPLACE** when new preference stated                                           |
| `core/workflows.md`     | Update when workflow learned/changed                                             |
| `core/relationships.md` | **ADD** people as mentioned; update context as learned                           |
| `core/triggers.md`      | **ADD** dates/deadlines; remove when passed or irrelevant                        |
| `core/projects.md`      | Update when project status changes; archive completed                            |
| `core/rules.md`         | **ADD** when correction detected; only remove if explicitly rescinded            |
| `core/session.md`       | Update every session; clear on major context switch                              |
| `core/improvements.md`  | **ADD** friction notes; **PROMOTE** at 2+ occurrences; **ARCHIVE** when verified |
| `core/journal.md`       | **APPEND** notable sessions at TOP; periodically prune old entries               |

All files are in `~/.claude/.context/`. Add new sections as needed.

## Notification Style

Brief notifications, not permission-seeking:
- ✅ "Done. I've noted your preference for uv over pip."
- ✅ "Updated session context with current focus."
- ❌ "Would you like me to add this to context?"
- ❌ "Should I update my records?"

---

## Lifecycle Management

| Type          | Action                                    | Trigger                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Preferences   | **Replace** in place                      | New preference contradicts old       |
| Relationships | **Add** new people; update context        | Person mentioned or context learned  |
| Triggers      | **Add** then **remove** when passed       | Date/deadline learned; date passes   |
| Projects      | **Archive** to bottom section             | Project completes                    |
| Session       | **Clear**                                 | Major context switch                 |
| Journal       | **Append** at top; **prune** periodically | Notable session ends; file gets long |
| Rules         | **Keep forever**                          | Only remove on explicit user request |

---

## Syncing Rules

After updating any of these files, consider running `/sync-context`:
- `rules.md` -- rules are included verbatim in imli-core.md
- `preferences.md` -- communication preferences are summarized
- `identity.md` -- identity summary is included
- `projects.md` -- active projects are listed

This regenerates `~/.claude/rules/imli-core.md` so future sessions see the changes immediately.

---

## Escalation (Rare)

Only ask the user when there's genuine ambiguity:
1. Contradictory info: "You mentioned preferring X, but I have Y. Which is current?"
2. Rule conflict: "You said never auto-commit, but now asking me to. Update my rules?"
3. Unclear correction: "Was that a correction or situational?"
