## Model Capabilities (Relevant to Skill Design)

Tracks model-level capabilities that affect whether skills remain necessary.
Updated during each `/evolve` run from Phase 1F research.

| Capability               | Proficiency        | Skill Design Implications                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web search & synthesis   | High (native tool) | Research wrappers likely unnecessary; orchestration skills that structure multi-search workflows still add value |
| Code generation & review | High               | Review skills add value through process enforcement, not raw capability                                          |
| Multi-step reasoning     | High               | Complex workflow skills remain valuable for discipline; simple sequential skills less so                         |
| Image generation         | Via MCP only       | Still needs skill orchestration for prompt engineering and iteration                                             |
| File manipulation        | Native tools       | Skills that just wrap Read/Write/Edit are unnecessary                                                            |
| Data analysis            | High               | Skills add value through structured output formats and domain frameworks, not raw analysis                       |

### How to Use This Table

During `/evolve` Phase 1.5 and `/upgrade-plugin` Phase 1.5:
- Compare each skill's core function against this table
- If a skill's primary value is something listed as "High" proficiency with no structural value-add, flag as potentially Superseded
- If a skill adds orchestration, process, or domain structure on top, it's likely Active or Augmented even if the underlying capability is native

## Settings & Permissions

| Tool gating (allowed-tools)       | No         | Could restrict tools in sensitive skills |
| Permission auto-approve patterns  | No         | Could streamline workflows               |
