# Evolve -- Research-Driven Self-Upgrade Pipeline

This skill researches the latest Claude Code platform state, audits Imli against it, plans upgrades, executes them, and verifies results. It auto-updates the reference files in this skill's `references/` directory to keep the knowledge base current between runs.

## Context Detection

Determine execution mode before doing anything else.

**Check:** Does `<cwd>/personal-assistant/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exist AND does `<cwd>/.git` exist AND does `<cwd>/CONVENTIONS.md` exist?

- **YES -- Source Mode.** Operating in the marketplace repo where Imli is maintained. Operate on skill files, hooks, and references directly. Bump version and update CHANGELOG when done.

- **NO -- Deployed Mode.** Show this disclaimer:

  > **Note:** Evolve is designed to run from Imli's source repo where the plugin is maintained. Running here will audit and modify your installed copy at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/...`. These changes will be overwritten on the next plugin update.
  >
  > To run from source, navigate to your marketplace repo.
  >
  > Proceed with deployed copy?

  Wait for confirmation. If declined, stop.

Set `imli_ROOT`:
- Source mode: `<cwd>/personal-assistant`
- Deployed mode: the installed plugin path (find via the highest version directory in `~/.claude/plugins/cache/prince-plugins/personal-assistant/`)

## Phase 1: Research

Run six research tasks in parallel using subagents. Each subagent summarizes its findings.

### 1A. Claude Code Changelog

Fetch latest Claude Code releases:

```
WebFetch: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases
```

Also check the raw changelog:

```
WebFetch: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-code/main/CHANGELOG.md
```

Extract from the last 3-5 releases:
- New tool capabilities or parameters
- New hook events or rule features
- Changes to skill loading, triggering, or frontmatter
- New agent/subagent patterns
- Deprecations or breaking changes
- Performance improvements relevant to skill design

### 1B. Claude Code Documentation (Discovery-Driven)

Discover the Claude Code documentation landscape. Do NOT hardcode doc page URLs -- discover them dynamically.

1. Find available documentation:
   ```
   WebSearch: "Claude Code" site:docs.anthropic.com
   WebFetch: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview
   ```

2. From the search results and overview page, identify and fetch pages covering these categories:
   - **Core infrastructure**: skills, hooks, rules, CLAUDE.md
   - **Agent capabilities**: subagents/Agent tool, agent teams
   - **Plugin system**: commands, output styles, MCP servers, plugin architecture
   - **Memory & context**: auto memory, context management
   - **Configuration**: settings, permissions, tool gating
   - **Workflow**: worktrees, session management

3. For each fetched page, extract:
   - Current best practices and recommended patterns
   - New features not in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/platform-capabilities.md`
   - Deprecated patterns Imli might still use
   - Capabilities Imli doesn't leverage yet

### 1C. Skill-Creator Best Practices

Find and read the installed skill-creator:

```
Glob: ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/skill-creator/*/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md
```

Extract:
- Current skill writing patterns
- Progressive disclosure guidelines (line limits, reference files)
- Description optimization guidance (triggering, "pushy" descriptions)
- Testing and evaluation patterns

### 1D. Superpowers & Platform Patterns

Check official plugins for patterns worth adopting:

```
Glob: ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/superpowers/*/skills/*/SKILL.md
```

Note structural patterns, frontmatter conventions, or composition techniques.

### 1E. Plugin Architecture

Understand the full plugin specification and what Imli could be using:

1. Read the marketplace conventions (source mode only):
   ```
   Read: <cwd>/CONVENTIONS.md
   ```

2. Examine other installed plugins for structural patterns:
   ```
   Glob: ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/*/skills/*/SKILL.md
   Bash: ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/*/ | head -50
   ```
   Focus on: plugin.json fields, agents/ directories, MCP server integration, output style patterns.

3. Compare Imli's plugin structure against the full spec:
   - What directories does Imli have vs. what's available?
   - What plugin.json fields exist vs. what Imli uses?
   - Are other plugins using agents/ or MCP servers effectively?

### 1F. Model Capability Assessment

Check for model-level improvements that may supersede Imli's skills:

1. Search for recent Anthropic model releases:
   ```
   WebSearch: "Anthropic Claude" model release OR capability update site:anthropic.com
   WebSearch: "Claude" new capabilities 2026
   ```

2. Fetch the models overview page:
   ```
   WebFetch: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models
   ```

3. Extract capabilities relevant to skill obsolescence:
   - Built-in tool use improvements (web search, code execution)
   - Reasoning and planning improvements
   - Multi-step task handling
   - Areas where dedicated prompting/orchestration adds less value

4. Compare against Imli's skill inventory:
   - For each skill, ask: "Does the model now do this well enough without specialized prompting?"
   - Flag skills where the answer is "yes" or "probably"

5. Cross-reference against `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/platform-capabilities.md` Model Capabilities table to detect changes since last run.

### Research Output

After all research completes, compile a Research Summary with sections:
- **New Claude Code Features** (from changelog + docs)
- **Updated Skill Best Practices** (from skill-creator)
- **Platform Patterns** (from superpowers and other plugins)
- **Plugin Architecture Gaps** (capabilities Imli doesn't use yet)
- **Deprecations & Breaking Changes**
- **Model Capability Overlap** (skills potentially superseded by model improvements)

In source mode: save to `<cwd>/.docs/upgrade-research/personal-assistant-<date>.md`

In deployed mode: present in-session only.

## Phase 1.5: Obsolescence Screen

Using research findings from Phase 1 (especially 1A, 1B, and 1F), evaluate whether each skill, agent, and major component in Imli is still necessary.

### Classification

For each skill and agent, assign one of:

| Rating | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Active** | Platform/model doesn't replicate this. Skill adds clear value. | Proceed to structural audit in Phase 2 |
| **Augmented** | Platform/model handles the basics, but skill adds meaningful structure, guardrails, or workflow orchestration on top. | Audit normally, but note what the platform handles natively |
| **Superseded** | Platform/model now does this natively with comparable quality. Skill adds marginal value over a direct prompt. | Skip structural audit. Recommend removal in Phase 3 plan. |

### How to Evaluate

For each skill, answer these three questions:

1. **What does this skill do that a direct prompt to Claude cannot?**
   If the answer is only "it saves typing a prompt" -- likely Superseded.

2. **Does this skill enforce a process, workflow, or multi-step structure?**
   Process skills (TDD, debugging, code review) remain valuable even when the model can do each step -- the skill enforces discipline. Likely Active.

3. **Has the platform added a native feature that replaces this skill's core function?**
   Example: Claude Code added native web search -> a "web research" skill that just wraps web search is Superseded. But a "competitor analysis" skill that orchestrates multiple searches into a structured report may be Augmented.

### Output

Present results as a table:

| Component | Type | Rating | Rationale |
|-----------|------|--------|-----------|
| [name] | skill/agent | Active/Augmented/Superseded | [1-line reason] |

If any component is rated **Superseded**, flag it for the user:

> **Obsolescence flag:** [N] component(s) appear superseded by platform/model capabilities. These will appear in the "Recommend Removal" section of the upgrade plan. Review the rationale -- override to Active or Augmented if you disagree.

Proceed to Phase 2, skipping structural audit for Superseded components.

## Phase 2: Audit

### 2A. Skill Inventory

For each skill in `${imli_ROOT}/skills/`, read the SKILL.md and evaluate:
- Frontmatter fields (follows latest conventions from Phase 1?)
- Line count (warn if over 500)
- Whether it uses `references/` or `scripts/` for progressive disclosure
- Composition patterns (`plugin:skill` syntax used correctly?)
- Hardcoded paths or stale assumptions
- Obsolescence rating from Phase 1.5 (skip detailed audit for Superseded components)

### 2B. Architecture Audit

Check the deployed system state:

```bash
cat ${imli_ROOT}/hooks/hooks.json
ls -la ~/.claude/rules/imli-core.md
ls ~/.claude/.context/core/
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(json.dumps(d.get('hooks',{}), indent=2))" 2>/dev/null
```

Verify:
- SessionStart hooks registered (not UserPromptSubmit)
- imli-core.md exists in rules/
- No duplicate notification hooks between plugin and settings.json
- Output style set correctly
- All expected context files present

### 2C. Gap Analysis

Compare current state against Phase 1 research:

| Category | Check |
|----------|-------|
| Skill structure | Frontmatter follows latest conventions? Under 500 lines? Progressive disclosure? |
| Descriptions | Triggering descriptions specific enough per skill-creator guidance? |
| Patterns | Uses latest Claude Code features? No deprecated patterns? |
| Composition | Follows `plugin:skill` invocation syntax? |
| Hook design | Non-blocking? SessionStart < 2 seconds? Uses `additionalContext`? |
| Plugin architecture | Using all beneficial plugin components (agents, MCP, output styles)? |
| System state | Platform capabilities and best practices references current? |

### 2D. Reference Freshness

Compare `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/platform-capabilities.md` and `best-practices.md` against research findings. Flag entries that are:
- Outdated (platform has changed)
- Missing (new capabilities not listed)
- Wrong (deprecated patterns still listed as current)

### 2E. Full Plugin Inventory

Check all plugin components, not just skills:

```bash
echo "=== Skills ===" && ls ${imli_ROOT}/skills/
echo "=== Hooks ===" && cat ${imli_ROOT}/hooks/hooks.json 2>/dev/null
echo "=== Output Styles ===" && ls ${imli_ROOT}/output-styles/ 2>/dev/null
echo "=== Plugin.json ===" && cat ${imli_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
echo "=== Agents ===" && ls ${imli_ROOT}/agents/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No agents/ directory"
```

Evaluate:
- **Output styles**: leveraging latest features? Under 120 lines?
- **Plugin.json**: all available fields used correctly?
- **Missing components**: would agents/ or MCP servers benefit Imli?
- **Structural patterns**: anything other plugins do that Imli should adopt?

### 2F. System State Check

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/platform-capabilities.md` System State section:
- Last evolve run date -- flag if > 60 days ago
- Claude Code version at last audit -- compare against latest from Phase 1A
- Imli version -- compare against plugin.json
- Platform docs last fetched -- flag if > 60 days ago

If System State section is missing, flag as "first evolve run" and note that all findings are new.

## Phase 3: Plan

Present a structured upgrade plan:

```
## Upgrade Plan: personal-assistant (Imli)

### Summary
- Current version: [from plugin.json]
- Proposed version: [with semver justification]
- Skills affected: N
- Reference files to update: N

### High Priority (Breaking/Deprecated)
1. [Change]
   - **Why**: [What's wrong or deprecated]
   - **What**: [Specific change]
   - **Risk**: [What could break]

### Superseded (Recommend Removal)
Components flagged as Superseded in Phase 1.5. Review before approving removal.

1. [Component name] ([type])
   - **What it does**: [1-line summary]
   - **What replaces it**: [platform feature or model capability]
   - **Migration**: [user-facing steps if any -- update docs, remove references]
   - **Risk**: [what's lost if removed]

### Medium Priority (New Features)

   - **Why**: [What capability this enables]
   - **What**: [Specific change]

### Low Priority (Polish)
1. [Change]

### Not Recommended
- [Considered but rejected, and why]
```

For removed components in source mode:
- Add CHANGELOG entry under "Removed"
- Version bump: MINOR if user-invocable skill, PATCH if internal-only component

<REQUIRED>
Wait for user approval before proceeding to Phase 4. The user may adjust priorities, skip items, or add their own.
</REQUIRED>

## Phase 4: Execute

Apply approved changes:

1. **One file at a time** -- read the full file before editing
2. **Preserve intent** -- upgrade patterns without changing what skills do
3. **Explain reasoning** -- prefer explaining why over heavy-handed MUSTs
4. **Keep prompts lean** -- remove things that aren't pulling their weight

### Reference File Updates

Update `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/platform-capabilities.md` and `best-practices.md` with findings from Phase 1. These files serve as "last known state" for future evolve runs.

### Model Capabilities Update

Update the Model Capabilities table in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/platform-capabilities.md` with findings from Phase 1F. Add new capabilities, update proficiency levels, and revise skill design implications.

### System State Update

After all changes are applied, update the System State section in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/platform-capabilities.md`:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Imli version | [from plugin.json after bump] |
| Last evolve run | [today's date] |
| Claude Code version at last audit | [latest version from Phase 1A research] |
| Platform docs last fetched | [today's date] |
| Model capabilities last assessed | [today's date] |

### Version and Changelog (Source Mode Only)

After all changes:
- Bump version in `${imli_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` per semver
- Update `${imli_ROOT}/CHANGELOG.md` in Keep a Changelog format

## Phase 5: Verify

### Validation Checks

```bash
for skill in $(find ${imli_ROOT}/skills -name "SKILL.md"); do
  echo "=== $skill ==="
  wc -l "$skill"
  head -5 "$skill"
  echo ""
done
```

1. **Diff review** (source mode) -- show `git diff` for user review
2. **Frontmatter check** -- all skills have valid frontmatter with name and description
3. **Line count** -- no SKILL.md over 500 lines
4. **Cross-reference check** -- any `plugin:skill` references still valid
5. **Convention check** -- changes follow CONVENTIONS.md

### Deferred Findings

For recommendations the user deferred or rejected, log to `~/.claude/.context/core/improvements.md` as Active Proposals:

```
### ENHANCEMENT evolve-deferred -- [Short description]
- **Evidence**: Evolve audit [date] -- [what was found]
- **Current behavior**: [what exists now]
- **Proposed change**: [what was recommended]
- **Status**: Deferred
