# Test Skill

Run or generate test suites for any skill -- task, discipline, or orchestrator -- and track results across versions for regression detection.

**Arguments:** $ARGUMENTS -- skill identifier (e.g., `creator-stack:write-note`, path to skill dir) and optional flags (`--generate`, `--headless`, `--tag <tag>`). If no skill specified, ask which one.

**Positioning:** Complements `skill-creator` (which focuses on iterative skill improvement). This skill answers: "does this skill still work?" Test artifacts are schema-compatible with skill-creator for deeper analysis when needed.

## Locate Target Skill

Find the skill to test:

1. If argument matches `plugin:skill` format, resolve:
   - `<cwd>/<plugin>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` (source mode -- marketplace repo)
   - `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/<plugin>/*/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` (installed mode)
2. If argument is a path, use directly
3. If not found, list available skills and ask the user to clarify

Set `SKILL_ROOT` to the directory containing `SKILL.md`.
Set `PLUGIN_ROOT` to the parent plugin directory (two levels up from skill).

---

## Detect Skill Type

Read `SKILL.md` and classify the skill into one of three types. This determines test generation strategy and execution behavior.

### Detection Heuristic

Read the skill's full content and apply these checks in order:

1. **Discipline** -- Skill enforces rules agents might resist:
   - Contains rationalization tables (`| Excuse | Reality |`)
   - Contains "Red Flags" or "STOP" sections
   - Uses "Iron Law", "NEVER", "No exceptions" enforcement language
   - Contains pressure scenarios or compliance checklists

2. **Orchestrator** -- Skill sequences other skills without generating content:
   - Invokes other skills via `plugin:skill` backtick syntax
   - Contains "Orchestrators never generate content" or equivalent
   - Workflow is primarily about sequencing, not producing output

3. **Task** -- Everything else (default):
   - Produces output (text, files, visuals, data)
   - Single responsibility -- does one thing well

Set `SKILL_TYPE` to `task`, `discipline`, or `orchestrator`.

Present to user: "Detected **[type]** skill. Does that look right?" Allow override.

---

## Check for Existing Tests

Look for `${SKILL_ROOT}/tests/evals.json`.

**If found:** Validate the file structure against the schema (see `references/schemas.md`). Report eval count and proceed to **Run Test Suite**.

**If not found:** Inform the user and offer options:
- **Generate tests** -- Auto-generate a draft test suite from the skill content (see `references/test-generation.md`)
- **Skip** -- Exit without testing

If `--generate` flag was passed, skip straight to generation without asking.

After generation, save to `${SKILL_ROOT}/tests/evals.json` and proceed to **Run Test Suite**.

---

## Run Test Suite

### Prepare Workspace

Create an ephemeral workspace as a sibling to the skill directory:

```bash
WORKSPACE="${SKILL_ROOT}-test-workspace"
RUN_DIR="${WORKSPACE}/run-$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%S)"
mkdir -p "${RUN_DIR}"
mkdir -p "${WORKSPACE}/history"
```

If the workspace is inside a git repo, check for a `.gitignore` entry. If missing, suggest adding `*-test-workspace/` to `.gitignore`.

### Filter Evals

If `--tag <tag>` was provided, filter evals to only those with a matching tag. Otherwise run all evals.

### Interactive Mode (Default)

For each eval in `evals.json`, create a task and dispatch subagents:

#### Step 1: Execute

Spawn an **executor subagent** per eval. Independent evals run in parallel.

Executor instructions:

```
You are a skill test executor. Your job:

1. Read the skill at: ${SKILL_ROOT}/SKILL.md
2. Read any referenced files the skill points to
3. Execute this prompt as if you were a user invoking the skill:

   "${eval.prompt}"

4. Use any provided input files from: ${SKILL_ROOT}/tests/fixtures/
5. Save your complete output to: ${RUN_DIR}/eval-${eval.id}/with_skill/outputs/
6. Write a detailed transcript to: ${RUN_DIR}/eval-${eval.id}/with_skill/transcript.md

Transcript format:
- Eval prompt (verbatim)
- Each action taken with tool used and result
- Final output
- Any issues encountered
```

**Discipline skills** with `"run_baseline": true` -- spawn a second executor WITHOUT the skill loaded:

```
You are a test executor. Execute this prompt WITHOUT any skill guidance.
Just respond naturally as you would by default.

"${eval.prompt}"

Save transcript to: ${RUN_DIR}/eval-${eval.id}/without_skill/transcript.md
Save outputs to: ${RUN_DIR}/eval-${eval.id}/without_skill/outputs/
```

#### Step 2: Grade

After each executor completes, spawn a **grader subagent**:

```
You are a skill test grader. Evaluate whether the execution met expectations.

Read the transcript at: ${RUN_DIR}/eval-${eval.id}/with_skill/transcript.md
Read outputs at: ${RUN_DIR}/eval-${eval.id}/with_skill/outputs/

Grade each expectation as PASS or FAIL with evidence.

IMPORTANT: Executors simulate skill execution -- they read the skill and
produce the output it would generate, but do not run live commands against
real backends. When an expectation says "runs command X", grade PASS if the
executor correctly constructed and presented the command in its output.
Do not penalize for simulated vs actual execution.

Save results to: ${RUN_DIR}/eval-${eval.id}/with_skill/grading.json

Use the grading.json schema from references/schemas.md:
{
  "expectations": [
    {"text": "...", "passed": true/false, "evidence": "..."}
  ],
  "summary": {"passed": N, "failed": N, "total": N, "pass_rate": 0.0-1.0}
}
```

**Discipline skill grading** -- the grader also checks:
- Baseline (without_skill) transcript shows violation of expected behavior
- With-skill transcript shows compliance
- Any `anti_behaviors` that appeared in the with-skill run are flagged as FAIL

**Orchestrator skill grading** -- the grader checks the transcript for:
- Skill invocations (look for Skill tool calls in transcript)
- Invocation order matches expectations
- No direct content generation (orchestrator didn't produce output itself)

---

### Headless Mode

When `--headless` flag is passed or when invoked via `claude -p`, run the same execution logic but:

1. All execution happens sequentially in the main loop (no subagents -- headless sessions have limited subagent support)
2. Read the executor and grader instructions above and follow them inline
3. After all evals complete, output a summary to stdout
4. The summary should be parseable -- start with `PASS` or `FAIL` on the first line

```bash
# Example headless invocation:
claude -p "/test-skill creator-stack:write-note --headless" \
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions \
  --add-dir /path/to/plugin
```

Note: Headless mode is slower (sequential) but provides full isolation. Use it for final validation before shipping, not for iterative development.

---

## Results and Reporting

### Aggregate Results

After all evals are graded, compile a run summary:

1. Read all `grading.json` files from the run directory
2. Calculate overall pass rate and per-eval results
3. Save `${RUN_DIR}/summary.json` -- see `references/schemas.md` for the full summary.json schema

### Regression Detection

Check for previous snapshots at `${WORKSPACE}/history/snapshots.json`.

If previous snapshots exist:
1. Compare current pass rate against the most recent snapshot
2. Compare per-expectation results -- identify any expectations that previously passed but now fail
3. Flag regressions prominently in the report

### Update Snapshot History

Append current run to `${WORKSPACE}/history/snapshots.json` -- see `references/schemas.md` for the snapshots.json schema.

Include:
- Timestamp (ISO-8601)
- Skill version (`<plugin>@<version>` from plugin.json)
- Pass/fail/total counts and pass rate
- Notes field (ask user if they want to add a note, e.g., "Baseline before voice rewrite"; leave empty if not)

### Display Report

Present a concise report to the user:

```
## Test Results: <skill-name> (<skill-type>)

Pass rate: X% (N/M) [PASS | REGRESSION from Y% | FIRST RUN]

| Eval | Tags | Status | Details |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| #1 ... | happy-path | PASS | 4/4 expectations |
| #2 ... | edge-case | FAIL | 2/3 -- "Voice matches..." failed |

[If regression detected:]
Regressed expectations (were PASS, now FAIL):
- "expectation text" (eval #N)

Results saved to: <workspace path>
Snapshot recorded in: <snapshots.json path>
```
